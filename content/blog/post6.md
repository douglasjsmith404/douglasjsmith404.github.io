### Styled (with Syntax)

Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.

```js
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
	let counter = 0;
	counter++;
}

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
```

```js
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
	let counter = 0;
	counter++;
}
```
and a line break above this line.

 
```js
// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
```

## Setting Up a GitHub.io Static Site with Svelte

Here's how to create a simple Svelte app and deploy it as a static website on GitHub Pages:

**1. Install Dependencies:**

- Make sure you have Node.js and `pnpm` (or `npm`) installed on your system. You can find download links on the official Node.js website ([https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)).

**2. Create a Svelte Project:**

Open your terminal and navigate to your desired project directory. Then, run this command to initialize a new SvelteKit project:

```bash
npx degit @sveltejs/kit my-sveltekit-app
cd my-sveltekit-app
```

Replace `my-sveltekit-app` with your preferred project name. This command uses `degit` to download the SvelteKit project template and sets up the initial project structure.

**3. Develop Your App:**

The `src` directory contains your Svelte components and pages. Here's a basic structure:

```
src/
  - App.svelte  (main layout component)
  - routes/
    - index.svelte  (homepage)
    - about.svelte  (about page)
  - ... (other components and pages)
```

- Edit the files within `src` to build your website's content and functionality. 
- Svelte uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for component creation.
- Refer to the Svelte documentation ([https://svelte.dev/docs](https://svelte.dev/docs)) for learning about components and building your app.

**4. Build for Deployment:**

Once you're happy with your app, run this command to generate the optimized static website files:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This creates a new `build` directory containing the production-ready website files.

**5. Create a `.nojekyll` file (optional):**

If your project name conflicts with Jekyll configurations on GitHub Pages, create an empty file named `.nojekyll` inside the `build` directory. This prevents Jekyll from processing your website files.

**6. Deploy to GitHub Pages:**

There are two main ways to deploy your website:

**Manual Deployment:**

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (or use an existing one).
2. Create a new branch in your repository named `gh-pages` (or any other branch you prefer for deployment).
3. Push the contents of your `build` directory to the `gh-pages` branch using Git commands or your preferred Git client.

GitHub Pages will automatically detect changes in the `gh-pages` branch and deploy your website to `https://<username>.github.io` (or your custom domain if configured).

**CI/CD with GitHub Actions (optional):**

This method involves setting up a workflow in GitHub Actions that automatically builds and deploys your website on push events. It requires additional configuration but allows for automated deployments. You can find tutorials online for setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions for SvelteKit projects.
